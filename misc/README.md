This `misc` directory contains several files :

1. All files needed to compile the manual; the command is `tex manual`.

2. `3d.ps` contains a collection of macros : for drawing arrows and for (very) rudimentary 3D graphics

3. `enum.py` is a script used to make changes in the numbering of sections and paragraphs in the manual
