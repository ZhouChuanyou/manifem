The roots of {\maniFEM} go back to a PhD thesis in 2002
% (or even earlier, to a Master thesis in 1997)
where finite elements on a torus were implemented in {\codett FORTRAN}.%

The torus is meant as a mere quotient manifold between $ \RR^2 $ and a group of
translations of $ \RR^2 $ with two generators; you may think of it as $ \RR^2/\ZZ^2 $.
It should be stressed that this manifold is not the usual ``donut'' built in paragraph
\numb section 2.\numb parag 15.
The quotient torus is a Riemann manifold with no curvature; it is locally Euclidian
(that is, locally isometric to open sets of $ \RR^2 $); we may call it ``flat torus''.
It cannot be embedded in $ \RR^3 $, much less be represented graphically.
An unfolded mesh in $ \RR^2 $ can be represented graphically, where vertices and segments
from the torus are drawn more than once.

One of the goals of {\maniFEM} is to deal with meshes on quotient manifolds.
Different quotient operations can be used, with groups of translations of $ \RR^2 $ but also
with other groups of transformations.


\paragraph{\numb section 5.\numb parag 1.
\special{ps: gsave 0.6 setgray}A one-dimensional circle\special{ps: grestore}}

{\bf The code described in this paragraph does not work yet.
It should be regarded as a mere declaration of intentions.}

Here is the closed curve $ \RR/\ZZ $.
We define it as a segment from {\codett A} to {\codett A}, with a specified {\codett jump}.

\verbatim
   // begin with the one-dimensional line
   Manifold RR ( tag::Euclid, tag::of_dim, 1 );
   Function x = RR.build_coordinate_system ( tag::Lagrange, tag::of_degree, 1 );

   // define an action on RR2 (a translation)
   Manifold::Action g;  g(x) = x+1;
   Manifold circle = RR.quotient ( g );

   // one vertex is enough to start the process
   Cell A ( tag::vertex );  x(A) = 0.02;
   // with this vertex, we build a segment
   Mesh seg ( tag::segment, A.reverse(), A, tag::divided_in, 10, tag::jump, g );
\endverbatim

We do not bother with the graphical representation of this one-dimensional mesh.


\paragraph{\numb section 5.\numb parag 2.
\special{ps: gsave 0.6 setgray}A flat torus\special{ps: grestore}}

{\bf The code described in this paragraph does not work yet.
It should be regarded as a mere declaration of intentions.}

Here is the classical example of $ \RR^2/\ZZ^2 $.

\verbatim
   // begin with the usual two-dimensional space
   Manifold RR2 ( tag::Euclid, tag::of_dim, 2 );
   Function xy = RR2.build_coordinate_system ( tag::Lagrange, tag::of_degree, 1 );
   Function x = xy[0], y = xy[1];

   // define two actions on RR2 (translations)
   Manifold::Action g1, g2;
   g1(x,y) = (x+1) && y;
   g2(x,y) = x && (y+1);
   Manifold torus_manif = RR2.quotient ( g1, g2 );

   // one vertex is enough to start the process
   Cell A ( tag::vertex );  x(A) = 0.02;  y(A) = 0.02;
   // with this vertex, we build two segments
   Mesh seg_horiz ( tag::segment, A.reverse(), A,
                    tag::divided_in, 10, tag::jump, g1 );
   Mesh seg_vert  ( tag::segment, A.reverse(), A,
                    tag::divided_in, 10, tag::jump, g2 );
   // and a rectangle
   Mesh torus ( tag::rectangle, seg_horiz, seg_vert,
                seg_horiz.reverse(), seg_vert.reverse() );

   // it would be meaningless to export 'square' as a msh file
   // we can however export an unfolded mesh :
   torus.unfold(-0.5,-0.2,0.5,0.2).export_msh ("unfolded-torus.msh");
\endverbatim

We have added a shadow representing the periodicity cell $ [0,1]^2 $.
This gives a hint about the segments being repeated by the unfolding.


\paragraph{\numb section 5.\numb parag 3.
\special{ps: gsave 0.6 setgray}A skew flat torus\special{ps: grestore}}

{\bf The code described in this paragraph does not work yet.
It should be regarded as a mere declaration of intentions.}

We can build a skew torus by simply choosing other actions on {\codett RR2}.

\verbatim
   Manifold::Action g1, g2;
   g1(x,y) = (x+1)   && (y+0.1);
   g2(x,y) = (x+0.1) && (y+1);
   Manifold torus_manif = RR2.quotient ( g1, g2 );
\endverbatim

Again, we have added a shadow representing the periodicity cell, this time a parallelogram.


\paragraph{\numb section 5.\numb parag 4.
\special{ps: gsave 0.6 setgray}A curved circle\special{ps: grestore}}

{\bf The code described in this paragraph does not work yet.
It should be regarded as a mere declaration of intentions.}

We are now in a position to resume the example in paragraph \numb section 2.\numb parag 14,
this time in a less cumbersome manner.

\verbatim
   Manifold RR ( tag::Euclid, tag::of_dim, 1 );
   Function theta = RR.build_coordinate_system ( tag::Lagrange, tag::of_degree, 1 );
   const double pi = 3.1415926536;
   Manifold::Action g;  g(theta) = theta + 2*pi;
   Manifold circle = RR.quotient ( g );

   Cell A ( tag::vertex );  theta(A) = 0.;
   Mesh seg ( tag::segment, A.reverse(), A, tag::divided_in, 10, tag::jump, g );

   // define new coordinates x and y as arithmetic expressions of theta
   Function x = cos(theta), y = sin(theta);
   // forget about theta; in future statements, x and y will be used
   circle.set_coordinates ( x && y );
   seg.export_msh ("circle.msh");
\endverbatim

\special{ps: gsave 0.6 setgray}A cylinder\special{ps: grestore}}

{\bf The code described in this paragraph does not work yet.
It should be regarded as a mere declaration of intentions.}

Here is how to build a cylinder in $ \RR^3 $ :

\verbatim
   Manifold RR2 ( tag::Euclid, tag::of_dim, 2 );
   Function theta_z =
      RR2.build_coordinate_system ( tag::Lagrange, tag::of_degree, 1 );
   Function theta = theta_z[0], z = theta_z[1];
   const double pi = 3.1415926536;
   Manifold::Action g;  g( theta, z ) = (theta+2*pi) && z;
   Manifold cylinder_manif = RR2.quotient ( g );

   Cell A ( tag::vertex );  theta(A) = 0.; z(A) = -1.;
   Cell B ( tag::vertex );  theta(B) = 0.; z(B) =  1.;
   Mesh AA ( tag::segment, A.reverse(), A, tag::divided_in, 10, tag::jump,  g );
   Mesh AB ( tag::segment, A.reverse(), B, tag::divided_in, 10 );  // no jump
   Mesh BB ( tag::segment, B.reverse(), B, tag::divided_in, 10, tag::jump, -g );
   Mesh cylinder ( tag::rectangle, AA, AB, BB, AB.reverse() );

   // define new coordinates x and y as arithmetic expressions of theta
   Function x = cos(theta), y = sin(theta);
   // forget about theta; in future statements, x, y and z will be used
   cylinder_manif.set_coordinates ( x && y & z );
   cylinder.export_msh ("circle.msh");
\endverbatim


\paragraph{\numb section 5.\numb parag 6.
\special{ps: gsave 0.6 setgray}A curved torus\special{ps: grestore}}

{\bf The code described in this paragraph does not work yet.
It should be regarded as a mere declaration of intentions.}

We are now in a position to resume the example in paragraph \numb section 2.\numb parag 15,
this time by using the quotient manifold $ \RR^2/\ZZ^2 $ introduced in paragraph
\numb section 5.\numb parag 2.

\verbatim
   Manifold RR2 ( tag::Euclid, tag::of_dim, 2 );
   Function ab = RR2.build_coordinate_system ( tag::Lagrange, tag::of_degree, 1 );
   Function alpha = ab[0], beta = ab[1];
   const double pi = 3.1415926536;
   Manifold::Action g1, g2;
   g1(alpha,beta) = (alpha+2.*pi) && beta;
   g2(alpha,beta) = alpha && (beta+2.*pi);
   Manifold torus_manif = RR2.quotient ( g1, g2 );

   Cell A ( tag::vertex );  alpha(A) = 0.;  beta(A) = 0.;
   Mesh seg_horiz ( tag::segment, A.reverse(), A,
                    tag::divided_in, 10, tag::jump, g1 );
   Mesh seg_vert  ( tag::segment, A.reverse(), A,
                    tag::divided_in, 10, tag::jump, g2 );
   Mesh torus ( tag::rectangle, seg_horiz, seg_vert,
                seg_horiz.reverse(), seg_vert.reverse() );

   // parametrize the donut
   const double big_radius = 3., small_radius = 1.;
   // define x, y and z as functions of alpha and beta
   Function x = ( big_radius + small_radius*cos(beta) ) * cos(alpha),
            y = ( big_radius + small_radius*cos(beta) ) * sin(alpha),
            z = small_radius*sin(beta);

   // forget about alpha and beta :
   torus.set_coordinates ( x && y && z );
   // in future statements (e.g. for graphical representation)
   // x, y and z will be used, not alpha nor beta :
   torus.export_msh ("torus.msh");

\endverbatim
